    I'm playing magician's assistant
    I know all your tricks but I'll listen
    I help you escape with this part I play

    But now I guess you gotta go
    Now you see me, now you don't
    and I thought I would try for you
    But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded

    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.

    That i'm blinded.

    Blinded.
    Blinded.

    But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

    But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

    I'm caught in the smoke in the

    mirrors.
    I'm getting so close now it's clearer.
    You fold me again
    with what could have been.

    But now I guess you gotta go
    Now you see me, now you don't
    and I thought I would try for you
    But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded

    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.
    Blinded.

    That I'm blinded.

    Blinded.
    Blinded.

    But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

    But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

    But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

    Bad habits in my brain
    Bad habits in my veins
    And I'm begging them to change
    But they are just not listening today

    All of the madness, all of the rage
    Only gets better when I feel pain

    Am I causing you pain, love
    I don't mean to
    As I run through your veins I'm
    Trying not to

    But I need them to see
    What they did to me
    Am I causing you pain, love
    I don't mean to

    Bad habits in my head
    Bad habits in my bed
    And I'm trying just to hold on
    To everything that I have known instead

    All of the madness, all of the rage
    Only gets better when I feel pain

    Am I causing you pain, love
    I don't mean to
    As I run through your veins I'm
    Trying not to

    But I need them to see
    What they did to me
    Am I causing you pain, love
    I don't mean to

    Am I causing you pain, love
    I don't mean to
    As I run through your veins I'm
    Trying not to

    But I need them to see
    What they did to me
    Am I causing you pain, love
    I don't mean to

    Full circle, deep purple
    Undertones in the undertone
    Not artificial, these words fizzle
    Up and out of my mouth

    I can phase through walls like a particle
    Part of me holds while rest of me holds on
    I can change the arrangement of all of us
    When not but a follower, like it's nothing

    I am satellite, I am so alive
    I am hovering in place like a dragonfly
    I am hydrochloric, I am alkaline
    I am everything you feel and you fantasize

    And the heart is on, like it's nothing
    And the heart is on, like it's nothing
    And the heart is on, like it's nothing
    And the heart is on, like it's nothing

    Dragonfly

    Dragonfly

    I can walk on the water like it's concrete
    Part of me falls while the rest of me runs free
    I can play with the shape of the entropy
    Nobody can intervene, like it's nothing

    I am satellite, I am so alive
    I am hovering in place like a dragonfly
    I am hydrochloric, I am alkaline
    I am everything you feel and you fantasize

    And the heart is on, like it's nothing
    And the heart is on, like it's nothing
    And the heart is on, like it's nothing
    And the heart is on, like it's nothing

    Full circle, no reversal
    Under oath in the summer glow
    Not artificial, these words fizzle
    Humming low from my broke

    You can walk, you can run
    I can fly, dragonfly
    You can walk, oh you can run
    But I can fly, dragonfly

    Dragonfly

    Dragonfly

    Full circle
    I take it full circle
    Full circle
    Full circle

    No matter how good that I get you
    At targeting your mind on one thing at a time
    Got a lot that you've got to do
    Caught you on your way out
    Hey, did you know that you breathe too
    And if our air ran out to minimal amounts
    How about that as a currency?
    Wouldn't that even things out?

    Tell me how's that PSI
    Hitting your skull when you
    Lie about your life
    So very tall in your mind
    Think no one sees how you hide
    I do, I do

    Wake up, you're collecting dust
    Your shine will start to rust
    You're in love with the ease of what
    All those Bens have had to say

    No matter how good that I get you
    At targeting your mind on one thing at a time
    Got a lot that you've got to do
    Caught you on your way out
    Hey, did you know that you breathe too
    And if our air ran out to minimal amounts
    How about that as a currency?
    Wouldn't that even things out?

    Tell me how's that PSI
    Hitting your skull when you
    Lie about your life
    So very tall in your mind
    Think no one sees how you hide
    I do, I do

    I like to party, drink all the lemonade
    I like to party, come ride the Waffle Wave

    Float on the gum drops in a pool of marmalade
    I like to party, come ride the Waffle Wave

    (I just wanna party)
    (I just wanna party)
    (I just wanna party)
    (I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna)
    Here we go
    Eechi me sanchi, I know I just want to eat (waffle)
    Eechi me sanchi, I just want a waffle wave
    Eechi me sanchi, I know I just want to eat
    Eechi me sanchi, I just want a waffle-

    Shunai ma kataimo, in the club you're a myto

    All night long
    I'm falling for you
    Fizzy Fantasies
    I'm taking on
    The chances of dreams
    Chasing you and me

    All night long
    I'm falling for you
    Fizzy Fantasies
    I'm taking on
    The chances of dreams
    Chasing you and me, and me...

    Here we go

    Do you know what's happening
    We've got a situation on the rise
    Did you see what was going on
    Or got a good look at her eyes

    Why must they look so fearful
    I'm only trying save your life
    Feels like 700 years I have been alive
    Stick it up, roaming the streets and set out to terrorize
    And born digital angel
    Unknowing, living a lie

    And I remember.
    Somewhere in my mind shows
    Itself time to time whole
    Visions from my past - the
    Last time I was
    Free
    From burdens and duties
    Last time I felt complete
    Ignorance is beauty

    She sells them cheap thrills,
    She know that she kills.

    High stakes, fun games,
    float away.
    "Can escape the night away",
    She said.

    Take a pill for it, here you go,
    Take a hit for it here you go,
    You don't need love,
    You don't need my love.

    But I'm addicted, to your love.
    Yes I'm addicted to your love.

    She was young, not so long ago,
    She sold smiles, like here you go,
    You don't need love,
    I don't need your love.

    But I'm addicted, to your love.
    Yes I'm addicted to your love.


    And if your mind still speaks take another
    Humankind’s still bleak undercover
    Yeah “I’m done” you swore to you mother
    But the truth is you rather mislead than recover
    And the mandate reads you wake, bake
    Cause you can’t take all the heartache
    And a mistake’s not a mistake if you don’t break
    Partake in a risk take with no handbrake uh
    A B C to X T C and I don’t trust you a moment alone so stay with me
    You sing all your LSDs, and will I pull you back on earth or will you sink with me?

    And I can see you’ve quit, say the drugs won
    Yeah there’s no point speak, cause you hear none
    I really thought I could get you out of this one,
    Help you when you freeze, run
    Break this whole addiction
    But I don’t know anymore
    Think I gotta let go
