    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre id="lyrics">Bad habits in my brain
Bad habits in my veins
And I'm begging them to change
But they are just not listening today

All of the madness, all of the rage
Only gets better when I feel pain

Am I causing you pain, love
I don't mean to
As I run through your veins I'm
Trying not to

But I need them to see
What they did to me
Am I causing you pain, love
I don't mean to

Bad habits in my head
Bad habits in my bed
And I'm trying just to hold on
To everything that I have known instead

All of the madness, all of the rage
Only gets better when I feel pain

Am I causing you pain, love
I don't mean to
As I run through your veins I'm
Trying not to

But I need them to see
What they did to me
Am I causing you pain, love
I don't mean to

Am I causing you pain, love
I don't mean to
As I run through your veins I'm
Trying not to

But I need them to see
What they did to me
Am I causing you pain, love
I don't mean to
