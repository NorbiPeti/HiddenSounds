    <pre id="lyrics">I'm playing magician's assistant
I know all your tricks but I'll listen
I help you escape with this part I play

But now I guess you gotta go
Now you see me, now you don't
and I thought I would try for you
But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded

Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.

That i'm blinded.

Blinded.
Blinded.

But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

I'm caught in the smoke in the

mirrors.
I'm getting so close now it's clearer.
You fold me again
with what could have been.

But now I guess you gotta go
Now you see me, now you don't
and I thought I would try for you
But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded

Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.
Blinded.

That I'm blinded.

Blinded.
Blinded.

But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.

But you turned all the tears I cried for you to gold and I'm blinded.
