    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre id="lyrics">Full circle, deep purple
Undertones in the undertone
Not artificial, these words fizzle
Up and out of my mouth

I can phase through walls like a particle
Part of me holds while rest of me holds on
I can change the arrangement of all of us
When not but a follower, like it's nothing

I am satellite, I am so alive
I am hovering in place like a dragonfly
I am hydrochloric, I am alkaline
I am everything you feel and you fantasize

And the heart is on, like it's nothing
And the heart is on, like it's nothing
And the heart is on, like it's nothing
And the heart is on, like it's nothing

Dragonfly

Dragonfly

I can walk on the water like it's concrete
Part of me falls while the rest of me runs free
I can play with the shape of the entropy
Nobody can intervene, like it's nothing

I am satellite, I am so alive
I am hovering in place like a dragonfly
I am hydrochloric, I am alkaline
I am everything you feel and you fantasize

And the heart is on, like it's nothing
And the heart is on, like it's nothing
And the heart is on, like it's nothing
And the heart is on, like it's nothing

Full circle, no reversal
Under oath in the summer glow
Not artificial, these words fizzle
Humming low from my broke

You can walk, you can run
I can fly, dragonfly
You can walk, oh you can run
But I can fly, dragonfly

Dragonfly

Dragonfly

Full circle
I take it full circle
Full circle
Full circle
