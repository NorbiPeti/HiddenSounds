    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre id="lyrics">She sells them cheap thrills,
She know that she kills.

High stakes, fun games,
float away.
"Can escape the night away",
She said.

Take a pill for it, here you go,
Take a hit for it here you go,
You don't need love,
You don't need my love.

But I'm addicted, to your love.
Yes I'm addicted to your love.

She was young, not so long ago,
She sold smiles, like here you go,
You don't need love,
I don't need your love.

But I'm addicted, to your love.
Yes I'm addicted to your love.


And if your mind still speaks take another
Humankind’s still bleak undercover
Yeah “I’m done” you swore to you mother
But the truth is you rather mislead than recover
And the mandate reads you wake, bake
Cause you can’t take all the heartache
And a mistake’s not a mistake if you don’t break
Partake in a risk take with no handbrake uh
A B C to X T C and I don’t trust you a moment alone so stay with me
You sing all your LSDs, and will I pull you back on earth or will you sink with me?

And I can see you’ve quit, say the drugs won
Yeah there’s no point speak, cause you hear none
I really thought I could get you out of this one,
Help you when you freeze, run
Break this whole addiction
But I don’t know anymore
Think I gotta let go
