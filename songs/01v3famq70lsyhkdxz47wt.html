    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre id="lyrics">No matter how good that I get you
At targeting your mind on one thing at a time
Got a lot that you've got to do
Caught you on your way out
Hey, did you know that you breathe too
And if our air ran out to minimal amounts
How about that as a currency?
Wouldn't that even things out?

Tell me how's that PSI
Hitting your skull when you
Lie about your life
So very tall in your mind
Think no one sees how you hide
I do, I do

Wake up, you're collecting dust
Your shine will start to rust
You're in love with the ease of what
All those Bens have had to say

No matter how good that I get you
At targeting your mind on one thing at a time
Got a lot that you've got to do
Caught you on your way out
Hey, did you know that you breathe too
And if our air ran out to minimal amounts
How about that as a currency?
Wouldn't that even things out?

Tell me how's that PSI
Hitting your skull when you
Lie about your life
So very tall in your mind
Think no one sees how you hide
I do, I do
